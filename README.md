This repo holds research and projects for a theory I call *Time Dilated Computing*

## Imagine a computer in deep space- in a gravitational field much less than that of earth. If such a computer could exist and be placed, what affect would time dilation have on the computing? 

The computing would still calculate in the same polynomial time as it does on earth; however, time dilation could cause us to realize the answer much faster.

Assume problem X takes 100 years to solve on machine A. On earth, A would solve X in 100 years. In this deep space region, A would still solve X in 100 years, but time in this deep space region would happen much faster with respect to earth. If, hypothetically, the time dilation caused 100 years to occur in the span of one day on earth, we would realize the absolute solution in 1 day. 

So, does such a place exist in the universe? Is it close enough to transmit light effeciently (i.e., not too many light years away)? 

There are obvious limitations to the practicality of this idea, but it is an interesting experiment nonetheless.
