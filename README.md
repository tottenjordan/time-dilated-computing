This repo holds research and projects for *Time Dilated Computing*

## In the known Universe, does significant gravitational time dilation exist that could contribute to meaningful computational gains for people of Earth?

1. At what gravitational filed would we realize a material gain?
2. Does such a field exist?
3. How far away are the closest ones?
4. If a compatible computer were already there, could problems and solutions be transmited as light, travel the distance, and maintain a material computational gain?
5. Explore limitations and possibilities of actually putting a computer in this space 

There are obvious limitations to the practicality of this idea.
