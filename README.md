## In the known Universe, does significant gravitational time dilation exist that could contribute to meaningful computational gains for people of Earth?

I'm envisioning a computer in a lower gravitational field than that of Earth. We send it problems that take years to solve, but we realize the solution much sooner. For now, I'd like to put a box around just figuring out the gravitational time-dilation pieces. 

1. At what gravitational filed would we realize a material gain?
2. Does such a field exist?
3. How far away are the closest ones?
4. If a compatible computer were already there, could problems and solutions be transmited as light, travel the distance, and maintain a material computational gain?
5. Explore limitations and possibilities of actually putting a computer in this space 

There are obvious limitations to the practicality of this idea, but it is an interesting experiment nonetheless.
