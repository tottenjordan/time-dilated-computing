# time dilated computing 

> can time dilation be used as a computational resource?

### gravitational time dilation
* think of time like a river. 
* sometimes rivers move slow, sometimes they move fast 
* Just as friction can slow down a river, mass (gravity) can slow down time

> if we place a computer in a lower gravitational field, can it execute more operations in relative time?

1. At what gravitational field would Earth realize a material gain?
2. Does such a field exist?
3. If so, how far away?
4. If a compatible computer were already there could problems and solutions be transmited as light, travel the distance, and maintain a material computational gain?
5. Explore limitations and possibilities of actually putting a computer in this space 

## TO DO:
### *Stationary celestial bodies and their gravity wells*
1. Create a subsample of 3D space which includes the 142 closest stars to Earth (142-3D)
2. Simulate the gravitaional space of '142-3D' (perhaps with vector fields?)
3. Define a sub-space of low gravity wells in '142-3D'
4. Determine time-dilation between Earth and low gravity wells 
5. Calculate light travel time between Earth and low gravity wells
6. Calculate break-even between Earth surface time and Schwartzchild bookkeeper time 

### *If potential advantages exist in the stationary, gravitational experiment: introduce velocity of the celestial bodies, i.e., calculate time dilation considering general and special relativity*
7. Simulate motion within '142-3D'
8. ...
